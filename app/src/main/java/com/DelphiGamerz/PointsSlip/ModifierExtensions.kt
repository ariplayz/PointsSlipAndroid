// import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier // etc. - Keep other imports if used by other functions in this file
// import androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color
// import androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp
// import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable

// The conflicting glassmorphism function has been removed from this file.
// If there were other modifier extensions in this file, they would remain.
// If this was the *only* function in this file, the file might now be empty
// or just contain the package declaration and necessary imports for other functions.

// Example: If you had another extension, it would still be here:
/*
@Composable
fun Modifier.anotherExampleExtension(padding: Dp): Modifier {
    return this.padding(padding)
}
